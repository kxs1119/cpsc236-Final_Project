# Quizmaker: Simulated Test Taking Application

## Description
Quizmaker is a Python code that simulates taking a test and returns the score. To run the program, execute the "client.py" file while ensuring that "source.py" and "testbank.csv" are in the same directory. The program guides the user through the following steps:

- Prompt the user to enter their first and last name. - Luke
- Prompt the user to enter their ID and validate it. - Luke
- Ask for 10 or 20 questions from the "testbank.csv" file. - Luke
- Start the quiz, displaying one question at a time. - Kenny and Kenny 
    - Receive input for the answer choice.
    - Prompt the user to re-enter a valid answer if it's invalid.
- Upon completion of the quiz, create a text file named: -Luke and Kenny
    - Format: StudentID_Firstname_Lastname
    - Include student ID, first name, and last name.
    - Score and elapsed time.
    - Text of selected questions, correct answers, and student's answers.
- Prompt users to either quit (Q) or clear and start again (S).

The text file with the results will be generated in the same directory as the "client.py" file.

## Requirements
- Python environment with necessary libraries.
- "source.py" file containing the code logic.
- "testbank.csv" file containing the test questions.
- User input validation for ID and answer choices.
