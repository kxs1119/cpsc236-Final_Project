# Final Project: Fantasy Game, Donkey Kong, and Quizmaker

## Overview
The final project combines three distinct elements: a Fantasy Game, a version of Donkey Kong, and a Quizmaker application. Each component offers unique experiences and challenges, providing entertainment and learning opportunities.

## Fantasy Game
The Fantasy Game is a modified version of Gemgem, featuring fantasy-themed background music, sprites, and sound effects. With a larger grid and two new gems, players must strategically plan ahead to match gems and score points. The game's visuals and audio create an immersive fantasy atmosphere, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Donkey Kong
Inspired by the classic arcade game, the Donkey Kong component challenges players to navigate obstacles and climb platforms to rescue the princess. With updated graphics and controls, this version of Donkey Kong retains the nostalgic charm while offering new levels and challenges for players to conquer.

## Quizmaker
The Quizmaker application simulates taking a test and provides a score based on the user's answers. Users can input their name and ID, select the number of questions from a test bank file, and answer each question sequentially. The application records the user's responses, calculates the score, and generates a detailed report including the user's name, ID, score, elapsed time, and selected questions with correct answers.

## Integration
The final project seamlessly integrates these three components, offering users a diverse range of activities to enjoy. Players can switch between the Fantasy Game, Donkey Kong, and Quizmaker, providing a well-rounded entertainment experience. Additionally, the project demonstrates the versatility of programming skills by combining different game mechanics and interactive elements into a cohesive package.

## Requirements
- Python environment with necessary libraries for game development and user interfaces.
