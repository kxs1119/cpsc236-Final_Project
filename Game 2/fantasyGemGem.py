"""
This program has "gem data structures", which are basically dictionaries
with the following keys:
  'x' and 'y' - The location of the gem on the board. 0,0 is the top left.
                There is also a ROWABOVEBOARD row that 'y' can be set to,
                to indicate that it is above the board.
  'direction' - one of the four constant variables UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
                This is the direction the gem is moving.
  'imageNum'  - The integer index into GEMIMAGES to denote which image
                this gem uses.
