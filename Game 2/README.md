## Description
Fantasy Gemgem is a modified version of the classic Gemgem game, featuring fantasy-themed background music, sprites, and sound effects. The game offers a larger grid compared to the original, increasing the width and length of the window, and it's resizable for better flexibility. 

Two new "gems" have been introduced, altering the gameplay significantly by increasing the number of sprites and requiring more strategic planning. The colors and backgrounds have been revamped to fit the fantasy theme, transitioning from light and dark blue to green and dark brown. 

Audio files have been replaced with fantasy sound effects, with a subtle reference to a favorite fantasy movie when making a bad swap.

## How to Run
Ensure you have the required sound and image assets, including badswap.wav, gem1-9, lotrBackground.wav, and match0-5.wav. Simply run the code, preferably in VS Code, to open the window and start the game.

## Gameplay
In Fantasy Gemgem, the objective is to match 3 or 4 of a kind to score points with each match. Your score gradually decreases over time, so maximizing matches quickly is crucial for a high score. However, if the grid becomes full with no available matches, the game ends, and you'll need to restart.

With the additional sprites, matching becomes more challenging, requiring strategic thinking and planning ahead compared to the original Gemgem.

## Requirements
- Sound and image assets: badswap.wav, gem1-9, lotrBackground.wav, match0-5.wav
- Python environment with necessary libraries.
